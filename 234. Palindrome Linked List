i was solving this after a long time, and i understood the logic of doing it with stack, and then i knew that fast and slow can be used but the actual logic wasnt clear, so 
after thinking for a while i thought about reversing the whole list and making new copy and then traversing both lists at the same time, and then i thought about reversing half of list will also work,
and that slow will stop at mid, so thats what i did, i also looked at the solution before coding so it was a bit medium level ig

            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }
        if (fast != null) slow = slow.next;
        //ListNode temp = slow;
